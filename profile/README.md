PortfolioTree.com helps you model portfolios to calculate various metrics for educational purposes. In this GitHub organization, we publish some of the code we use to calculate those numbers. We hope to colaborate with you on developing code for financial analysis and automated investing.

[Contact us](https://portfoliotree.com/contact) if you have any ideas or feedback. If you like something about our website, feel free to ask for us publish it here on GitHub as open source software.
